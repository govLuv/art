<h2>Model</h2>
<div class="essay">
Artists will be able to publish essays and comment on their own and other essays. A comment 

may either be a root comment or a reply. A root comment is attached to a specific part of an 

essay, a reply to another comment.

Artists may also highlight comments they find particularly insightful and record quotes from 

essays. They can bookmark essays they wish to read later.

The following is a rough schema for a relational database.

<h3>Artist</h3>

name

password

email

<h3>Essay</h3>

artist_id

content

post_time

post_anon? (give user to option to post some essays without their name)

<h3>Comment</h3>

essay_id

artist_id

content

post_time

<h3>Root_comment</h3>

comment_id

position (position in the essay, can be done by line number range)

<h3>Reply</h3>

comment_id

parent_id

<h3>Quote</h3>

essay_id

artist_id

content (perhaps just specified by position in essay if we want to save space)

position (so we can jump back to place in essay immediately)

<h3>Highlight</h3>

aritst_id

comment_id

<h3>Bookmark</h3>

essay_id

user_id

mark_time

We would also want heuristics to suggest essays and figure out which comments to display if 

thereâ€™s a densely discussed portion of the essay.
