# Purpose

# Site Structure
## Model
__Artist__s publish __essay__s and __comment__ on their own and other essays. 
A comment may either be a __root comment__ or a __reply__. A root comment is 
attached to a __page__ of an essay, a reply to another comment.

Artists may also __highlight__ comments they find particularly insightful and record
__quote__s from essays. They can __bookmark__ essays they wish to read later (though
this could perhaps be automated).

The following is a rough schema for a relational database.

### Artist
- name
- password
- email
- ad_banner?
### Essay
- artist_id
- title
- introduction
- public_comments?
### Page
- essay_id
- number
### Comment
- essay_id
- artist_id
- content
- post_time
### Root_comment
- comment_id
- quote_id
### Reply
- comment_id
- parent_id
### Quote 
- page_id
- artist_id
- content 
### Highlight
- aritst_id
- comment_id
### Bookmark
- essay_id
- user_id
- page_number

We would also want heuristics to suggest essays and figure out which comments 
to display if there's a densely discussed portion of the essay.
 
Possible heuristics for essays:

- number of times linked to in other comments
- number of comments it has 
- number of times it has been quoted

Possible heuristics for comments:

- number of times highlighted
- number of replies
- heuristics based on user

_**Potential direction of progress:** create an abstraction layer that 
allows users to visualize and organize relationships between essays._

## Pages

### Home

#### Returning Users
Modules to display quote collection, essays read 
or published, highlighted comments. Suggestions for next read.

#### New Users 
Site's statement of purpose. Explanation of site layout. 

Link to simple registration page.

### Essay

#### Composition

Textbox to submit [Markdown](http://dafoster.net/projects/rdiscount/)
formatted essays. 

Option to save as a draft.

To add:

- [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) Support

#### Presentation

Presented in two column or one column format depending on page width.

When user highlights portion of the text, box appears asking if user 
would like to comment or add text to quote collection. 

Some sources to help accomplish this:

- [Text highlight event](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3731328/on-text-highlight-event)
- [Position element next to highlight](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1589721/how-can-i-position-an-element-next-to-user-text-selection/1589912#1589912)
- [Text selection coordinates](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6846230/javascript-text-selection-page-coordinates)

User can double-click to highlight a comment.

Potential issue: quotes that span more than one column.. perhaps reduce 
to single column format as we slide.

Other additions to the essay page include:

- Button that links to author's page
- Button to bookmark the essay

### Artist's Page

#### As viewed by the Artist
Space to edit personal info and open essay drafts.

Space to review quotes, comments, bookmarks, highlights.

To consider:

- Add alias options?

#### As viewed by a visitor
Lists the essays by this author. Lists any other info the author has volunteered.

Potentially cycle through quotes the author has specified (from own work or others).
